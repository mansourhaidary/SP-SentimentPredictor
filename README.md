# SP-SentimentPredictor
Machine learning and fine tuned transformer models used to predict the sentiment of Arabic sentences (positive, negative or neutral). The models were trained on custom datasets mined from famous domains such as booking, tripadvisor, googleplay and noon. These datasets were obtained and cleaned by the team's algoirthm to fully clean the data from noise before training. Each dataset contained over 80k Arabic reviews, and each dataset focuses on a specefic genre. for exmaple, googleplay reviews are game reviews and booking reviews are hotel reviews. For that reason, there were more than 20 models, each focusing on a specific genre. The team has used RNN, LSTM, BI-LSTM, SVM, LR, NB, ARABERT, and CamelBert to obtain a experimental analysis of the different models (all documented in our research paper). Lastly, the datasets should be published in the near future.
